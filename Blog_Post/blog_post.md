## UX role

### The Idea

The process of looking for a therapist in Berlin is challenging. In addition to this it takes a long time and it can be quite frustrating. The idea of Theraply was developed to create a helpful instrument to ease this process. Offering a complete, clean Website that gives informations, filters and other aids that can help during the search. 

### The Basics

From the very beginning we started brainstorming to decide which would be the basics functionalities of the Webpage. What was very important to have and what less, keeping in mind that if time allows we would develop all of them.  

The Core Functionalities are:
- A process overview
- A tracking system that shows the users at which point of the process they are
- Different search filters
- Search results showing ratings for each therapist
- Possibility to contact more therapists at once
- A template to contact therapists

### The UX Process

The UX process started with the user research. Following the competition analysis and the interviews we had a clear view of who our "target audience" is and whichgit add. the most important "issues" to be addressed were. 

Users can be summed up on average to 3 types: 

- The first are those who start their search and after a very complex process, find a therapist
- The second wants to start therapy but gives up after a while of searching 
- The third are those who want to start therapy but don't even begin to search because they feel unmotivated knowing the complexity of the process 

In short, everyone feels frustrated and overwhelmed.
The personas, storyboards and scenarios were thought of and created after this evaluation. Because of this and consequently to the theme of our project, the design should be simple, clean and relaxing. Intuitive and easy to navigate.

### Wireframing

Back to brainstorming, ideas and sketches for the first basic wireframes on paper, which we then presented to the rest of the Team to give a quick idea of the direction we were going to take.The webpage will follow a hierarchical IA model, which felt the most appropriate for our webpage. 
Following the first low fidelity wireframes, we moved to Figma to create a mid fidelity wireframe, with further development of what were our first ideas on paper and some modifications. Once finished with the basics we started creating all the animated interactions and went through a lot of frustrations, videos, trial and error, headaches, more frustrations and solutions. Doing this on the mid fidelity wireframe proved to be a terrific choice, helping us move to the next step and in many instances facilitating our work during the development of our end design.

### The new design

Moving to the final UI development, brought with itself a new and different level of obstacles and headaches. Brainstorming colours, design ideas, shapes, illustrations, fonts, misunderstandings, different tastes, wash, rinse repeat..

We kept calm (kinda) and carried on (for sure) with loads of coffee on our side. Slowly but steadily it started getting shape. Throughout the process, it was possible to experiment with new functions, tools, ideas and designs. In general it was all very interesting and with a lot of learning, and some more headaches, when you think you finished, you try it and, on the second run 3 things stopped working.

### Testing and Adjusting

We run some user tests with our prototype in Figma. This was a little awkward for the users because of some “unnatural” behaviour of the program, (unnatural for a web page) when many interactions are present in one page. i.e. after using the search the user need to click again to close the interaction to move to the next, while in an actual webpage the interactions flow. 
Following the test evaluation, some adjustments have been made, correcting on parts that without testing  probably wouldn’t have been noticed, for example some parts of the text were too small, even in bigger screens, the menu “Tests” wasn’t as self explanatory as thought, we went therefore with “Psychological Tests”. 
With the advice from our mentor and track leader we were also able to improve some things.

We found interesting how one "issue" sometimes helps correcting another, giving us a vision of what we are creating and understanding it. Likewise the opinion and advice of the users helped us review what can be improved or modified. Even asking ourselves why we did it this way. 
It was very interesting to see everything connecting and taking shape. And finally, see our finished project.
