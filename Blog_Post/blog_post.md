## UX Track

### The Idea

The process of looking for a therapist in Berlin is challenging. In addition to this it takes a long time and it can be quite frustrating. 
The idea of Theraply was developed to create a helpful instrument to ease this process. Offering a complete, clean Website that gives informations, filters and other aids that can help during the search. 

### The Basics

From the very beginning we started brainstorming to decide which would be the basics functionalities of the Webpage. What was very important to have and what less, keeping in mind that if time allows we would develop all of them.  

The Core Functionalities are:
- A process overview
- A tracking system that shows the users at which point of the process they are
- Different search filters
- Search results showing ratings for each therapist
- Possibility to contact more therapists at once
- A template to contact therapists

### The UX Process

The UX process started with the user research. Following the competition analysis and the interviews we had a clear view of who our "target audience" is and which the most important "issues" to be addressed were. 

Users can be summed up on average to 3 types: 

- The first are those who start their search and after a very complex process, find a therapist
- The second wants to start therapy but gives up after a while of searching 
- The third are those who want to start therapy but don't even begin to search because they feel unmotivated knowing the complexity of the process 

In short, everyone feels frustrated and overwhelmed.
The personas, storyboards and scenarios were thought of and created after this evaluation, Because of this and in accordance with the theme of our project,the design should be simple, clean and relaxing - Intuitive and easy to navigate.

### Wireframing

Back to brainstorming, ideas and sketches for the first basic wireframes on paper, which we then presented to the rest of the Team to give a quick idea of the direction we were going to take.The webpage will follow a hierarchical IA model, which felt the most appropriate for our webpage. 
Following the first low fidelity wireframes, we moved to Figma to create a mid fidelity wireframe, with further development of what were our first ideas on paper and some modifications. Once finished with the basics we started creating all the animated interactions and went through a lot of frustrations, videos, trial and error, headaches, more frustrations and solutions. Doing this on the mid fidelity wireframe proved to be a terrific  choice, helping us move to the next step and in many instances facilitating our work during the development of our end design.

Moving to the final UI development, brought with itself a new and different level of obstacles and headaches. Brainstorming colours, design ideas, shapes, illustrations, fonts, misunderstandings, different tastes, wash, rinse repeat..

###### A view of some of our interactions

We kept calm (kinda) and carried on (for sure) with loads of coffee on our side. Slowly but steadily it started getting shape. Throughout the process, it was possible to experiment with new functions, tools, ideas and designs. In general it was all very interesting and with a lot of learning, and some more headaches, when you think you finished, you try it and, on the second run 3 things stopped working.

### Testing and Adjusting

We ran some user tests with our prototype in Figma. This was a little awkward for the users because of some “unnatural” behaviour of the program, (unnatural for a web page) when many interactions are present in one page. i.e. after using the search the user need to click again to close the interaction to move to the next, while in an actual webpage the interactions flow. 
Following the test evaluation, some adjustments have been made, correcting on parts that without testing  probably wouldn’t have been noticed, for example some parts of the text were too small, even in bigger screens, the menu “Tests” wasn’t as self explanatory as thought, we went therefore with “Psychological Tests”. 
With the advice from our mentor and track leader we were also able to improve some things.

###### Profile page before and after

We found it interesting that working on one issue all of a sudden presented another one to solve,  a new insight of what we were creating  which wasn't there before emerged, which helped us understand how to procede. Likewise the opinion and advice of the users helped us determine what can be improved or modified. All of this got us wondering at a certain point why did we even do it this way. 
It was very exciting to see everything connecting and taking shape and finally, see our finished project.

## Frontend Track 

### Kübra

During the project phase, I realized two crucial things, it is wildly different to code along or to code on your own, and also that it is deeply satisfying to be able to do so. Seeing the project slowly come alive was a thrilling experience. Also, I learned that coding takes time. 

“Oh, a simple button surely won’t take long right? Wrong!”

##### Progess of the registration form

Sometimes I was shocked about the amount of time it took me to solve a seemingly easy task. 
While working on the frontend code I heavily focused on the UI, trying desperately to make everything look like our designers have imagined them. I am a very visual person and I truly enjoy beautiful design, so I was quite driven to match everything to a tea. By doing so I failed to consider that the page actually needs to function as well. That arguably obvious fact took me almost an embarrassing time to realize. 
At the same time, with almost a childlike glee, I saw that step by step I was able to perform tasks and the code with more comfort plus a plan of what I wanted to do. 
I mainly was responsible for creating the registration form and also the home page/landing page. I wished I would have been able to accomplish more in the time given to us. If I learned anything I would like to pick up the pace in which I make progress and also be able to research quicker and better solutions for the challenges I face during coding. I also struggled with creating responsive sites and I definitely feel like that’s an aspect that is still lacking in my code. 
If anything, the whole project motivates me to keep learning and growing as a beginner coder. Despite the challenges I faced during the project I was also immensely grateful for our team. I experienced the communication as quick, transparent, and direct in a respectful and kind way. I think everybody did great work and I’m truly inspired by seeing the growth and drive of everyone involved! Additionally, I was thankful for our mentor Nik as well. I had the impression that I was able to gain insight into what working in the tech world would look like and how to organize ourselves. Of course, the feedback was helpful too!
Overall, I’m glad that I was able to take the course at TechLabs Berlin. :)
